# [My Car Administration](https://my-car-ruszkipista.herokuapp.com/)
A Flask and MongoDB-Atlas based CRUD application, styled with Material Design Bootstrap. Inspired by the "Task Manager" code along mini project by the same name in the Code Institute curriculum. This project is my third milestone in obtaining the [Full Stack Web Development](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/) diploma from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

## 4. Technologies and Tools Used

- The project's product (the website) was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising [Bootstrap 5.0 Beta](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) framework (which itself uses CSS and JavaScript). Bootstrap is used for its responsive utilities. 
- Manipulated images with program [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/). Mainly used for cropping, resizing, background removal and format conversion.
- downloaded [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos with [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/)
- extracted and cut sound clips with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- Created wireframes with program from [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)
- Written study notes on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)
- Disassembled a PDF file with [Adobe Acrobat PRO](https://acrobat.adobe.com/ie/en/acrobat.html)
- Edited the code with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the page preview was provided via [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) VS Code extension.
- Managed code versions with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Stored the code and project deliverables cloud service [Github](https://github.com/) repository with versions.
- Deployed the website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- The development machine run [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) operating system.
- The website was tested on desktop on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) web browsers, also on a [Asus Google Nexus 7 (2013)](https://www.gsmarena.com/asus_google_nexus_7_(2013)-5600.php) tablet running [Android OS](https://www.android.com/) and mobile [Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en) browser.
- Generated favicon with [Favicon & App Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- Generated one image (on top of this Readme) of how the website looks on different size devices with [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
- Chose font using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Run CSS code through [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to supplement suggested vendor prefixes
- Searched the internet to find content, documentation and solution for issues using [Google](https://www.google.com)'s search service.
- connected to the internet using [Vodafone](https://n.vodafone.ie/shop/broadband.html)'s broadband service.

## 5. Issues solved during development
...

## 6. Testing

First step in testing was the validation of HTML, CSS and JS code with [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) respectively. 
The whole testing was conducted manually on Windows 10 desktop device running Chrome browser on a 1920x1080 resolution screen and on an Android tablet. Not tested on mobile phone, because the limited sceen estate does not allow game play in a way as intended.

See the whole <a href="https://ruszkipista.github.io/cims03-my-car/assets/doc/ci-ms3-test-log.html" target="_blank">test log</a> in a webpage.

No additional bugs were discovered during the final testing.

Conclusion: The website performs on desktop and tablet as intended.

## 7. Deployment
 
### Deployment in development environment

#### 0. Python and Git
Make sure, that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) are installed on your computer

### 1. Set up the MongoDB-Atlas hosted database

Make a free account on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) an recreate the database

#### 2. Clone the project's GitHub repository

1. Locate the repository here https://github.com/ruszkipista/cims03-my-car
2. Click the 'Code' dropdown above the file list
3. Copy the URL for the repository (https://github.com/ruszkipista/cims03-my-car.git)
4. Open a terminal on your computer
5. Change the current working directory where the cloned folder will be located
6. Clone the repo onto your machine with the following terminal command
'''
git clone https://github.com/ruszkipista/cims03-my-car.git
'''

#### 3. Create local files for environment variables
Change working directory to the cloned folder and start your code editor or IDE
```
cd cims03-my-car
code .
```
Create file `envWS.py` with the following content into the root of the project folder
```
import os
os.environ.setdefault("FLASK_SECRET_KEY", "<secret key>")
os.environ.setdefault("FLASK_IP",         "127.0.0.1")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT",             "5500")
os.environ.setdefault("FLASK_DEBUG",      "True")
```
Create file `envDB.py` into the root of the project folder with the following content:
```
import os
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_CLUSTER",    "<cluster name>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB_NAME",    "my_car")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB_USER",    "<username>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB_PASS",    "<password>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_INIT",       "True")
```
The MONGO_INIT=True parameter trigger the initialization of the database every time you start the application. To prevent that, set it to `False` to persist your changes in the DB.
  
#### 3. Set up the Python environment
In your development environment, upgrade pip if needed
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```
Install `virtualenv`:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
```
virtualenv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Start the web server:
```
python app.py
```

### Deployment to Heroku

## 8. Credits

### Acknowledgements
My inspiration for this project came from ...

I thank [Nishant Kumar](https://github.com/nishant8BITS) for mentoring me during the project. He suggested to study [Clean Code](http://cleancoder.com/) by Uncle Bob and split up the monolith code into small functions. Despite much of my efforts, Uncle Bob still would not approve the current state of the code, there is still much to learn ...

### Media
Used 4 car images from google search, edited and resized them
